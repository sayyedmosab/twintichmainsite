## Memory Tool Protocol

### Hierarchical Memory Management
- **Memory Bank Tool**: Used for overall project planning, major milestones, and persistent progress tracking
- **Todo List Tool**: Used for detailed task breakdown within specific components/features (session-based)

### Usage Guidelines
1. **Memory Bank**: Big picture planning, overall project status, major component progress
2. **Todo List**: Detailed implementation steps for current active work
3. **Example**: Bilingual project tracked in Memory Bank, Header component tasks in Todo List

### Persistence Strategy
- Memory Bank files persist across sessions (stored on disk)
- Todo List is session-based and may reset between VS Code restarts
- Use Memory Bank for long-term tracking, Todo List for immediate task management
