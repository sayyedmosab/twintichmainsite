# Progress (Updated: 2025-09-18)

## Done

- Identified and validated all deltas between implementation and requirements
- Created comprehensive sequential fix plan with precise specifications
- Applied cube color corrections (0x1f2937 base, 0x9f7bff purple target)
- Updated text overlay CSS with correct font sizes (66pts/44pts/24pts/18pts) and block widths (650px/560px)
- Adjusted lighting intensities to match requirements (1.0 for directional lights)
- Fixed pixel ratio clamp to 2.0 as specified
- Implemented face pattern consistency using faces.json
- Corrected edge color logic for navy and purple cubes

## Doing

- Final verification of animation smoothness and transitions
- Testing phase handover logic for reversible scrolling

## Next

- Document verification results
- Mark investigation complete if all transitions work smoothly

## Bilingual Implementation Progress (Arabic/English Support)

### Overall Status: In Progress (20% Complete)

### Major Milestones

#### ðŸ›  Recent Edit Impact (2025-09-18)

- Files added/modified during arabization work:
   - `src/i18n.ts` (new) â€” i18n initialization (react-i18next + language detector)
   - `src/locales/en.json` (new/updated) â€” English translation keys (includes `header.languageToggle`)
   - `src/locales/ar.json` (new/updated) â€” Arabic translations (missing some header keys)
   - `src/components/Header.tsx` (modified) â€” added `useTranslation` and `i18n` usage; navigation and auth texts wired to `t()` in many places but a few hardcoded strings remain (TwinLab title, some language toggle text)
   - `src/main.tsx` (modified) â€” imports `./i18n` to initialize translations

- Observed issues immediately after the edits:
   - A large cascade (~389) of TypeScript/JSX parsing errors was reported by the language service and compiler. Many errors point at `src/components/Header.tsx` (around the header JSX) and `src/main.tsx`.
   - Root-cause analysis so far: edits introduced i18n wiring and modified JSX. The most likely triggers are (a) remaining hardcoded JSX/text that needs to be replaced with `t(...)` keys, and/or (b) editor/TS server/cache mismatch after dependency and optimized-deps changes.

- Quick status (what's known right now):
   - i18n infra is present and configured (`src/i18n.ts`).
   - `en.json` contains `header.languageToggle` keys but does not yet include a `header.twinLabTitle` key.
   - `ar.json` is present but missing the `header.languageToggle` group and `header.twinLabTitle` key; this must be added.
   - `Header.tsx` uses `t()` for nav labels and some buttons but still contains the hardcoded TwinLab title and uses raw Arabic/English strings for the language toggle in two places (desktop + mobile). These remaining hardcoded strings are scheduled for replacement.

#### âœ… Immediate Next Actions (before restarting dev server)

1. Replace remaining hardcoded strings in `src/components/Header.tsx` with translation keys (desktop/mobile language toggle, TwinLab title).
2. Add missing keys to translation files (`header.twinLabTitle` and `header.languageToggle` in `ar.json` and `en.json` where missing).
3. Run TypeScript validation locally (`npx tsc --noEmit`) to surface real compile errors separate from editor false-positives.
4. Clear Vite optimized cache (`rm -rf node_modules/.vite`) and restart dev server (`npm run dev`) to force a fresh dependency build.

These steps are tracked in the session todo list (Header translation fixes, tsc validation, clear cache).


#### âœ… **Completed**
- i18n infrastructure setup (react-i18next, language detector, translation files)
- Basic Header component integration (partial - navigation, auth buttons, mobile menu)

#### ðŸ”„ **In Progress**
- Complete Header component translations (language toggle, TwinLab title, subLinks)
- RTL CSS support implementation

#### ðŸ“‹ **Remaining Major Tasks**
1. **Component Translations** (by priority):
   - Footer component (copyright, contact)
   - Authentication pages (LoginPage, RegisterPage, AuthCallback)
   - HomePage content (all scrolling sections)
   - Other pages (Roadmap, TwinLab, etc.)

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - RTL CSS support for Arabic layout
   - Mobile animation optimizations
   - Cross-device testing and validation

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Next Priority**
Complete Header component â†’ RTL CSS â†’ Footer component â†’ Auth pages â†’ HomePage content
