# Episode 1.3: The People Transformation

*“Complex change fails when experience digs in and energy burns out. Fuse them and complexity becomes leverage.”*

#### **Why People Transformation is Pivotal**

- As Org charts, processes, and even whole directorates are reinvented; the human mix must evolve even faster to be able to lead and shape the change.  
- Two distinct talent pools begin to appear:  
  - **Old Guard (OG)**: Career civil-servants, custodians of the government reputation, deeply empathetic to citizen trust, and shielded by a civil-service contract that rewards patience.  
  - **New Pioneers (NP)**: Private-sector entrants hungry for quick wins, self-burdened to show value, and still decoding the ministry’s political compass.  
- Left to default behavior, the gap widens; harnessed well, they deliver a hybrid advantage—**institutional memory plus disruptive practice**.

#### **The Double-Edged Sword Dynamic**

| Trait | Old Guard (OG) | New Pioneers (NP) | Risk if Unmanaged | Opportunity if Fused |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Core driver | Reputation first, beneficiary-centric | Prove worth through rapid results | Conflicting agendas stalls progress | Calculated risks at high value opps |
| Observed Behavior | Conservative and slow adoption | High risk appetite to experiment | Random pursuits, hit and miss | Real opportunities pursued |
| Time horizon | Long-term | Yearly renewal | Parallel plans, mis-aligned priorities | Balanced quick wins & legacy upgrades |
| Stakeholder map | Deep, informal networks | Limited, high-profile contacts | NP push change without OG political cover | OG opens doors, NP reshapes processes |

#### **Two Battlefronts for Integration**

#### 1\. Culture by Design – Winning Hearts

- Craft a Mission Culture Canvas that:  
  - Ties OG job security to citizen-trust KPIs.  
  - Channels NP entrepreneurial spirit toward public-value problem-solving.  
  - Positions the ministry as a talent hotspot—“where purpose meets innovation.”  
- Embed the canvas in HR touchpoints: onboarding, pulse surveys, promotion panels, recognition schemes.

#### 2\. Cascading Change Interventions – Winning Minds

To penetrate the Break high-level change campaigns into deliverable-adoption micro-interventions:

- Define who must use each deliverable, how, and by when.  
  - Pair mixed OG & NP champion pairs accountable for adoption metrics.  
  - Publicly track adoption rates against programme milestones.

#### **From → To Framing**

| From (Legacy Split) | To (Complexity-Ready Fusion) |
| :---- | :---- |
| OG guards stability / NP chase quick wins | Unified value narrative linking reputation and innovation |
| Siloed change campaigns | Deliverable-adoption micro-interventions with shared accountability |
| Culture emerges by chance | Mission Culture Canvas engineered & audited quarterly |
