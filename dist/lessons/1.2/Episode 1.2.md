# Episode 1.2: What is a Sector Transformation?

#### **The Anatomy of a Sector**

The starting point is understanding the Sector Value Chain. The value chain is a known concept (Porter, 1985)[^1] described from a private sector company point of view. The same concept has been adapted later to allow for:

- **Scale** across multiple private sector companies (the definition we want) and to:  
    
  *“At the **industry or sector level**, value chains map the full progression of activities—sourcing, production, distribution, sales, and end-of-life across multiple firms and geographies”*  
    
- **Different outcomes** suited to the public sector focusing on public services leading to citizen trust. This is where Episode 1.1 focused.

Within the sector value chain, roles differ and are complex and highly specialized. However, a simple framing that works in most cases is to look at it as follows:

#### **What Constitutes a Transformation?**

A transformation signifies a shift in the sector’s operating logic, where the government engages in producing a Suite of Reform Policies that aims to change the investment map to a new unrecognizable state.

#### **Conditions That Trigger Sector Reform**

Sector transformations typically arise when:

- The outcome is citizen-facing but cannot be owned end-to-end by a single entity (e.g., job creation, food security, investment attraction).  
- Major reforms require shared infrastructure (e.g., unified data platforms, joint permitting systems, federated service portals).  
- Cross-ministry strategies emerge (e.g., Vision 2030-style national plans).

For example, in Mining, the realization of the rich and diverse presence of natural minerals against the demand triggered a change in the sector from an operating ministry to issue basic licenses for building materials, to a global hub for innovation and home to critical minerals in demand.

Once the reform is in place, the sector settles into normal policy tools being utilized. Sectors require stability and hence the exceptional injection of policies cannot become an ongoing state and will cool down at some point once the intended objectives are achieved.

#### **Why Sector Transformation is So Hard**

#### Policy Execution is a “Full-Time” Job and Needs Focus

While the leading ministry focuses on its prime role as a regulator, most of the other tools (although remaining under the Ministry’s accountability) are typically delegated to entities in the ecosystem that specialize in them.

This means creating new entities or adapting existing ones to a new role, resulting in multiple organizational transformations at the same time.

Ministries siloed by mandate, funding, and KPIs must collaborate.

Leading Ministries have to focus on planning policy execution across sectors and intersecting national programs to:

- Avoid conflict with existing laws—even outside their direct jurisdiction.  
- Anticipate long-term ripple effects across the sector.  
- Include mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and adjust based on real-world performance data.

#### Driven by Opportunity, Not Competition

Unlike the private sector, there is no competitive pressure forcing integration. Sector transformation must be designed intentionally and push through resistance. Change becomes more difficult as it requires bringing the buy-in of public staff to new ways of working based on the fear of losing on an opportunity, making a highly illogical step from a public servant perspective.

#### Example: Unlocking the Mineral Resources Economic Potential

###### *Business-as-Usual (Pre-Transformation):*

- Ministry dominated by licensing basic building materials with minimal inspections.  
- GIS maps from exploration indicated massive opportunities.  
- Without an incentive to pursue these opportunities, the ministry stayed stagnant for over 70 years.

###### *Post-Transformation Mode:*

- A major shift in positioning the natural resources as global opportunities in an industry tapping out in finding rich resources to mine.  
- A growing international leader in the mining global sector with the investment opportunities presented and supported by a government.  
- The ecosystem reshaped with multiple entities either re-imagining their role for more specialization and other new ones established to fill gaps.

### **Key Takeaways**

- A sector transformation redesigns the full ecosystem—not just one organization.  
- New ecosystem roles change, resulting in new entities set up and existing ones shifting.  
- It is triggered when no single entity can deliver the outcome alone.  
- Success requires shared goals, joint planning, aligned incentives, and real-time data exchange.  
- With all this, the sector players from investors and workforce look nothing like before.
