# Episode 1.3: The People Transformation

**Recap**

In the last two episodes, we learned that major change in a sector is not just about technology or new rules, but about how organizations and people work together. True transformation means everyone involved must adjust and cooperate, sharing the same goals and information, because no single group can succeed alone. This big shift in working together prepares the way for the important changes needed in the people and teams who will lead the future.

> *“Complex change fails when experience digs in and energy burns out. Fuse them and complexity becomes leverage.”*

## Why People Transformation is Pivotal

- As org charts, processes, and even whole directorates are reinvented, the human mix must evolve even faster to be able to lead and shape the change.
- Two distinct talent pools begin to appear:
  - **Old Guard (OG):** Career civil-servants, custodians of the government reputation, deeply empathetic to citizen trust, and shielded by a civil-service contract that rewards patience.
  - **New Pioneers (NP):** Private-sector entrants hungry for quick wins, self-burdened to show value, and still decoding the ministry’s political compass.
- Left to default behavior, the gap widens; harnessed well, they deliver a hybrid advantage—**institutional memory plus disruptive practice**.

## The Double-Edged Sword Dynamic

| Trait                | Old Guard (OG)                        | New Pioneers (NP)                | Risk if Unmanaged         | Opportunity if Fused                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Core driver          | Reputation first, beneficiary-centric  | Prove worth through rapid results | Conflicting agendas stall progress | Calculated risks at high value opps |
| Observed Behavior    | Conservative and slow adoption         | High risk appetite to experiment  | Random pursuits, hit and miss | Real opportunities pursued          |
| Time horizon         | Long-term                             | Yearly renewal                    | Parallel plans, mis-aligned priorities | Balanced quick wins & legacy upgrades |
| Stakeholder map      | Deep, informal networks               | Limited, high-profile contacts    | NP push change without OG political cover | OG opens doors, NP reshapes processes |

## Two Battlefronts for Integration

### 1. Culture by Design – Winning Hearts
- Craft a Mission Culture Canvas that:
  - Ties OG job security to citizen-trust KPIs.
  - Channels NP entrepreneurial spirit toward public-value problem-solving.
  - Positions the ministry as a talent hotspot—where purpose meets innovation.
- Embed the canvas in HR touchpoints: onboarding, pulse surveys, promotion panels, recognition schemes.

### 2. Cascading Change Interventions – Winning Minds
To penetrate the Break high-level change campaigns into deliverable-adoption micro-interventions:
- Define who must use each deliverable, how, and by when.
- Pair mixed OG & NP champion pairs accountable for adoption metrics.
- Publicly track adoption rates against programme milestones.

### From → To Framing

| From (Legacy Split)                | To (Complexity-Ready Fusion)                  |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| OG guards stability / NP chase quick wins | Unified value narrative linking reputation and innovation |
| Siloed change campaigns            | Deliverable-adoption micro-interventions with shared accountability |
| Culture emerges by chance          | Mission Culture Canvas engineered & audited quarterly |

## A Practical Approach to Implement and Measure Success

1. **Map the tribes** – catalogue OG & NP roles, influence circles, hidden leaders.
2. **Form quick-win squads** – each pairs an OG process owner with an NP change driver.
3. **Install micro-learning loops** – weekly 5-minute nudges tied to current blockers.
4. **Reward shared outcomes** – gain-sharing bonuses for squads hitting adoption & citizen-trust targets.
5. **Audit & pivot quarterly** – track culture indicators; tweak incentives or squad mix as needed.

### Key Indicators

| Indicator                                   | Baseline | 12-month target |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Deliverables with mixed OG/NP champion pairs | 10%      | ≥ 80%           |
| Adoption rate of new deliverables (≤30 days) |          |                 |
