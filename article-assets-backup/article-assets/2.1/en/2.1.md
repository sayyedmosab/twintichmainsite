# Episode 2.1: Strategic Performance (KPIs)

#### **Introduction**

In Episode 1.4, we saw how public-sector transformation is “entangled”—sector outcomes depend on organizational capabilities, and each piece must align for change to happen. But how does a Vision 2030 macro target—like “increase non-oil GDP”—actually cascade down to something a department or analyst can influence?

#### **Why Cascading Matters in Vision 2030**

Vision 2030 sets ambitious, sector-wide targets. But success requires breaking each goal into actionable, owned, and reviewed KPIs—from the national level all the way down to L3 frontline process metrics. The cascade isn’t just vertical—some leading and operational KPIs link horizontally across ministries or agencies, making collaboration essential.

##### Indicator Types

The best way to explain the cascade is to take an example from the highest level all the way down. For our example, we choose the GDP as one of the most common and visible economic indicators.

But first, let’s understand how our definitions fit in this context. Think of the Saudi economy as a high-tech dashboard. Each gauge (indicator) helps leaders steer toward Vision 2030. There are three types we are interested in for the moment:

- **Lagging Indicators**: These are like taillights, showing where we’ve been. They change *after* the economy shifts, confirming past trends. Example: Government spending more after a bad year to help out.  
- **Leading Indicators**: These are like headlights, showing what’s coming. They change *before* the economy does, hinting at future growth or slowdowns. Example: Businesses investing in new factories because they expect more sales.  
- **Coincident Indicators**: These are like your speedometer, showing what’s happening now. They move *with* the economy, reflecting its current state. Example: The number of people with jobs rising as the economy grows.

In Saudi Arabia, with its mix of oil and Vision 2030’s push for tourism and industry, these indicators help leaders like the Ministry of Finance or GASTAT (the stats agency) steer the economy.

#### **GDP Formula Components**

Saudi Arabia uses the expenditure approach to GDP:

\[ \text{GDP} \= \text{Consumption (C)} \+ \text{Investment (I)} \+ \text{Government Spending (G)} \+ (\text{Exports (X)} – \text{Imports (M)}) \]

- **C (Consumption)**: Money people spend on stuff like food, clothes, or trips. In Saudi Arabia, this includes locals buying groceries or tourists spending at Riyadh Season.  
- **I (Investment)**: Money businesses or the government spend on future projects, like factories, hotels, or NEOM’s skyscrapers.  
- **G (Government)**: Money the government spends on schools, hospitals, or roads, tracked through budgets on Saudi Arabia’s Etimad system.  
- **X (Exports)**: Value of what Saudi Arabia sells abroad, like oil, chemicals, or tourism services for foreign visitors.  
- **M (Imports)**: Value of what Saudi Arabia buys from other countries, like cars or tech.

#### **How Do They Impact the Economy?**

This simple question not only helps identify them quickly (as you will see in a moment), but it helps you understand the state of the economy with one quick glance.

To figure out if an indicator is leading, lagging, or coincident, ask: **“Does it move before, with, or after the economy?”**

- Government Spending (“G”) is a lagging indicator—moves after the GDP, responds after the economy shifts. Same applies for C, X, and M.  
- Investment (“I”) is a classic leading indicator—moves before GDP and leads the economy.  
- Employment is coincident—moves with GDP, and it is illustrated exactly because it is not in the formula. Coincident indicators (relative to another indicator) rarely appear in the same formula, as they run in parallel and are usually influenced by the same factors in the same manner.

#### **Quarterly Shifts**

Let’s look at how these moves (after, before, with) manifest visually.

Look for the pattern. All the indicator’s charts look very similar to the GDP one but shifted in time per the definition:

#### **Turning Macro Targets into Transformation KPIs**

Each ministry contributes to GDP in different ways, some more than others. Some drive Investment (I), others drive Government Spending (G) like Health, or Consumption (C) like Tourism. In this example, we trace the Ministry of Investment’s full line of sight down to the working level, but the same cascade logic applies across all components and owners.

To turn a Vision 2030 macro target into actionable change, we break it down into a structured, formula-driven KPI cascade with clear ownership at every level.

In this example, we trace the Ministry of Investment’s contribution (“I” for Investment) all the way down to L3.

##### KPI Cascade Example: Ministry of Investment’s Contribution to GDP

| Level | KPI | Formula / Components | Notes |  |  |  |  | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| L0 | **GDP Growth** Owned by Min. Economy & Planning Strategic Lagging | C + I + G + (X-M) | Each component aggregates from multiple ministries and sources |  |  |  |  | 
| L1 | **Total Annual Investment (I)** Owned by Ministry of Investment Strategic Leading | LDI + FDI + Expansions | A mix of fresh quality capital with non-cash value-add, and healthy growth of existing capital |  |  |  |  | 
| L2 | **FDI - Projects in Operation** Owned by Investment Attraction Division Operational Lagging | **Investment Cycle** (Opp, Business Case, Reach outs, Incentives, DTI, License, Construction, Operational) | A filtering down relation makes the first one the weakest. This is also the widest part, and home of Horizontal cascades |  |  |  |  | 
| L3 | Opportunity Owned by Data Hub Operational Leading | **Decision** Owned by Investment | Operation Owned by Services | 2000 Opps | 20 Decisions | 4 Open | For this case we expand to showcase an example of an End to End process enforcing collaboration |

Here, the cascade ends as far as the Transformation is responsible. This is because L3 processes are not performed by an individual; rarely any are like that.

Individuals can perform specific tasks described in step-by-step procedures, usually referred to as L4 and L5.

The link does not stop though, as it continues through a handshake with the HR individual performance reviews. This is usually based on Job Descriptions (JDs) and competencies to measure performance against them.

That’s why it is critical that the HR Performance system is designed with the L3 Processes in mind. If not, then there will be a disconnect.

#### **Governance, Measurement, and Intervention**

- **Ownership**: Each KPI (at every level) has a named business owner, data owner, and is reviewed in a regular cadence meeting.  
- **Measurement**: We loosely use the term KPI, yet it contains the baseline, target, actual, trend, variance—all must be tracked.  
- **Intervention**:  
  - In the absence of a cascade, interventions are after the fact, and sadly by external observers. Yet even in such cases, tracing the problem becomes seamless.  
  - In a cascade, the intervention holds foresight and predicts ahead of time any challenges, allowing time to prevent or mitigate the impact.

##### The Big Unlock

This kind of cascade has many benefits, yet these might be the biggest two by far:

- **Priorities**: A fragmented entity can be easily spotted when there is continuous “debate” on what should be the priority? Conflicting opinions and resistance to collaborate or adopt major programs.  
- **Cross-Department Collaboration**: We always knew KPIs influence behaviors, and in a normal vertical cascade, it can even reach to influence individuals. Yet the Horizontal cascade brings genuine buy-in that is more powerful and effective than many change programs.

#### **Key Takeaways**

1. Vision 2030 macro goals become real only when they are broken into clear KPI cascades—each owned, measured, and linked to specific actions.  
2. Strategic Leading Indicators (like Investment) are the critical entry point for ministries and organizations to shape their organizations around national results.  
3. Every lagging KPI must be connected, via explicit formulas, to leading, then operational, and then process metrics—tying external variables and internal performance together.  
4. Measurement, ownership, and intervention are disciplined, regular, and actionable at every step of the chain.  
5. Collaboration matters: Horizontal cascading and external drivers must be managed—not just siloed KPIs.
