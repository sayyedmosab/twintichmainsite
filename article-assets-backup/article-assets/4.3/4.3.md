# Day 61-90: Launch Your First Integrated Governance Forum

Launch Your First Integrated Governance Forum (Days 61-90): Stand up a monthly integrated review focused exclusively on your chosen thread. Use the provided GenAI-powered demo site as an example of how to present integrated data and facilitate a data-driven conversation. This builds the muscle memory for the new way of working and demonstrates immediate value to leadership.
