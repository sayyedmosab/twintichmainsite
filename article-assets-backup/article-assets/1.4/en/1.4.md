**Recap**

*“The sector is where we set the destination; the organization is where we build the vehicle for the journey; and people are the ones who must work together to win the race.”*  
In 1.1, we saw how organizations transform themselves; in 1.2, how sectors reshape roles and set national ambitions; and in 1.3 how people are the ones to manifest real change.  
In an entangled transformation, these journeys are woven together.

 **Episode 1.4: The Entangled Transformation**

### **A.**    **Choosing the right arsenal per Complexity level**

In sector-wide public transformation programs—where ministries, authorities, and agencies must evolve together—the challenge is not just the ambition of change, but its complexity. Until now, there has been no structured, quantifiable way to assess that complexity before execution begins.

This proposal introduces a Public Sector Complexity Index (CI) \- a simple, scalable formula designed to do just that. It allows program leaders and transformation designers to measure the true burden of change across a multi-entity ecosystem. 

##### **🔹 Complexity Index (CI)**

**![][image1]**

| Symbol | Meaning | Scale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ![][image2] | Strategic weight or importance of entity (i) amongst others (how much of the sector transformation is relying on the entity) | % weight out of the whole |
| ![][image3] | Severity of transformation required for entity (i) (1–5 scale) | 1 – Manageable 5 – New entity |
| ![][image4] | ![][image5] | Ratio |
|   | ![][image6] Number of non-established external stakeholders entity ( i ) must coordinate with (never worked with before) | Count |
|   | ![][image7] Baseline manageable number of external dependencies (sector-specific) | Avg of 5 |

##### **🔍 What It Captures**

This single weighted-average formula collapses three dimensions of transformation into one score:

1. **Internal disruption** — how deep each entity’s change is.  
2. **Strategic role** — how central each entity is to the sector’s mission.  
3. **External Load** — how many other players each entity must engage with.

 

Each entity’s individual transformation burden is scaled based on its real-world coordination load. The output is a single number that reflects the system-wide complexity of execution.  
**Example**

| Entity | Weight ![][image8] | Severity ![][image9] | External New ![][image10] | External Load ![][image11] | Contribution ![][image12] x  *![][image13]* x *![][image14]* |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Ministry A | 5 | 5 | 15 | 1.5 | 37.5 |
| Regulator B | 3 | 4 | 10 | 1.0 | 12.0 |
| Operator C | 2 | 2 | 4 | 0.4 | 1.6 |
| Support Unit D | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0.2 | 0.2 |

{Total Weighted Contribution} \= 37.5 \+ 12.0 \+ 1.6 \+ 0.2 \= 51.3

{Total Weight} \= 5 \+ 3 \+ 2 \+ 1 \= 11

{CI} \= {51.3}{11} \= 4.66

 

This CI of 4.66 reflects the overall complexity of the transformation. **But it also opens the door to something deeper.**

##### **🧠 Beyond the Average: Diagnostic Insights**

After computing the CI, each entity’s normalized complexity score can be calculated:

 **Normalized Complexity\_i \= s\_i {E\_i}{B}**

 Comparing this against the system-wide average (CI) reveals outliers—entities whose burden is disproportionately high. This flags potential issues in the operating model design.

##### **🔁 What to Do with Outliers:**

\-        **Too high?** Consider breaking apart roles, delegating delivery, or spinning off entities (e.g., create an authority or SOE).

\-        **Too low?** Consider absorbing adjacent responsibilities to improve efficiency.

---

##### **📌 Why It Matters**

This Complexity Index is more than a metric. It’s a planning instrument, early-warning signal, and design aid that lets public-sector leaders:

\-        Quantify and compare transformation efforts before they begin.

\-        Spot operating model overload before failure.

\-        Redesign ecosystem roles and delivery logic to normalize transformation load.

 It brings clarity to an area too often driven by guesswork—and gives transformation offices the numbers they need to act.

### **B.**    **Mapping to Archetype and Practices**

Your complexity profile determines your transformation archetype and toolkit.

| Complexity Profile | Transformation Archetype | Practice Approach |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Low on all axes | Localized/Focused | Traditional project management |
| Moderate (2 axes high) | Holistic/Entity-wide | Standard portfolio tools |
| High on 3-4 axes | Value Chain/Integrated | Capability architecture, cross-team |
| All axes high | Sector Maestro/Systemic | Full architecture, portfolio, change management |

When you land in the “**Sector Maestro**”/high complexity zone, you must use the full suite of advanced practices—capability-based architecture, outcome-based planning, strategic portfolio management, and more. 

#### **Cascading & Capability Dissection**

Cascading is the process of breaking the sector strategy into actionable layers—L0 (strategy) to L3 (execution)—across every domain.

| Domain | L0 | L1 | L2 | L3 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Strategy & KPIs | Strategic Objective | Leading Indicators | Operational KPIs | Process Metrics |
| Portfolios | Transformation Portfolio | Programs | Initiatives | Master Deliverables |
| Processes | High-Level Functions | Process Groups | Categories | Steps |
| Org Structure | Entity | Main Unit | SubUnit | Teams/Individuals |
| Change & Culture | Narrative | Target Behaviors | Enablement Tools | Habits & Rituals |
| Planning & Cadence | Multi-Year Strategy | Annual Plans | Quarterly Cycles | Weekly Activities |

### **C.**    **Sector Capability Mapping: The Heart of Entangled Transformation**

In an entangled transformation, the sector is the master architect.

·        National Strategic Objectives (SOs) (e.g., “Grow Clean Energy Sector”) sit at the top.

·        These SOs cascade into Sector Capabilities—policy tools like regulations, platforms, incentives, and enforcement.

·        Each capability is assigned to one or more entities (ministries, agencies, authorities)—not just departments.

·        This triggers org-level transformation in each entity, aligning teams, systems, and processes to deliver their assigned policy tool.

·        Execution at each org then feeds back into overall sector outcomes.

 **Examples**

**Sector Objective**: Boost national manufacturing share

**Sector Capabilities (Policy Tools)**:

\-        Regulation (new investment law)

\-        Service Platform (export licensing portal)

\-        Incentive (capital subsidy scheme)

\-        Enforcement (market inspection regime)

**Entities**:

\-        Ministry of Industry (leads regulation)

\-        Export Authority (operates platform)

\-        Investment Agency (delivers subsidy)

\-        Quality Authority (runs inspection)

**Org Capabilities**:

\-        Regulatory drafting teams

\-        Digital process units

\-        Analytics and outreach

**Execution**:

Each policy tool is rolled out, with cross-entity feedback, KPIs tracked at sector level

This alignment ensures the vertical clarity of L0–L3 is achieved across the sector, not just inside one organization.

#### **Key Takeaways**

§  **Sector-as-Master**: Entangled transformations are sector-driven, with the sector’s capability map assigning priorities to each entity.

§  **Complexity Matrix**: Use scale, change radius, severity, and dependencies to diagnose your starting point.

§  **Cascade & Capability**: Trace every SO down to policy tools and responsible entities, ensuring capabilities are mapped and built for delivery.

§  **Alignment at All Levels**: Organizational transformations are triggered and shaped by sector needs, not just internal ambitions.

§  **End-to-End Logic**: The journey runs from sector objective → sector capability (policy tool) → entity assignment → org transformation → execution and impact.
