# Debugging Summary: Rubik's Cube Finale Button Issue

## Problem
The "Enter" buttons in the final animation phase of the `rubiks-cdn.html` experience are not navigating to their respective routes (`#/twinlab` and `#/roadmap`). The buttons are clickable, but no navigation occurs.

## Context
- The animation is in an `iframe` within a React application.
- The React app uses `HashRouter` for routing.
- The `iframe` has the `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock allow-top-navigation"` attribute, which is correct.
- The CSS `pointer-events` for the finale section have been corrected to allow clicks.

## Failed Solutions & Observations
1.  **`replace` Tool Failures:** Multiple attempts to use the `replace` tool on `rubiks-cdn.html` failed. This was due to two primary reasons:
    *   **External File Modification:** An unknown process appears to be modifying the file, causing the `old_string` parameter to become outdated and resulting in "0 occurrences found" errors.
    *   **API Token Limit:** One attempt to replace the entire file content resulted in a `maxOutputTokens` error because the file was too large for the tool's parameters.

2.  **JavaScript `handleNavigation`:** The file contains custom JavaScript (`handleNavigation`, `initializeNavigation`) to manage link clicks. This was identified as overly complex and likely unnecessary.

## Last Attempted Solution
The agreed-upon solution is to simplify the navigation by removing the custom JavaScript event handling entirely and letting the standard HTML `<a>` tags handle the hash-based navigation.

**Action Items for Next Session:**
1.  Verify that the user has restarted their environment for a fresh start.
2.  Read the latest content of `public/rubiks-cdn.html`.
3.  Create a new version of the content in-memory by removing the `handleNavigation`, `initializeNavigation` functions, and the `setTimeout` call that invokes them.
4.  Use the `write_file` tool to overwrite `public/rubiks-cdn.html` with the simplified, corrected content.
