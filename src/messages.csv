When user starts scrolling, the cube shrinks gradually till reaches right starting point for animations.",1,Transforming Strategy Execution,COMPLEXITY AS AN ASSET,"Most transformations fail because complexity overwhelms. We turned that complexity into an advantage—redefining planning, risks, and dashboards inside one integrated model.",-

Farfetched? It’s here. We built the MVP: a Net.js web app with a Supabase database and a Gemini Assistant, built on a five-year scenario dataset inspired by real transformation events.",Add link on bolded text to the video.

This journey begins by uncovering the questions that matter most—the ones that unlock how complexity really works.","repeated animation means the the animation timing must spans the time it takes to comfortably transition the multiple text blocks. This is the only exceptional case. After this, the animation timing takes over."
2,2: First Dismantle / Dramatic Cloud;,4,The Anatomy of an Organization ,WHAT MAKES AN ORGANIZATION?,"Many things, like a living system of systems—Strategy, Policies, Processes, Digital—shaped by external forces such as markets and global events. Real transformation means understanding how these components interact, not treating them in isolation.",-

4,4: 27 cubes to 27 Rubiks,5,The Hidden Relations,HOW DEEP DOES IT GO?,"Each component has its own inputs, outputs, and hidden ties to others. When those ties are mapped, patterns emerge—a structure that shows why small changes ripple across the whole system.",-
5,5: Second dismantle into 729 cubes,6,The Moment of Truth,SHOULD YOU WALK THIS JOURNEY?,"We already did—and the answer is yes. But do it with eyes open. Complexity runs deeper than expected, and guidance is scarce. That’s why we built a model that captures the whole picture and makes the path navigable.",-
6,"6: Popcorn Recolor, 1 by 1, slow then fast",7,"Locks, Locks Everywhere",WHAT DID TWO YEARS REVEAL?,"Two years of relentless work, unlocking barrier after barrier. Each layer exposed new dependencies, each cube revealed hidden ties. Piece by piece, the digital twin took shape—a living map of complexity. And just as it came together, AI leapt forward, suddenly powerful and accessible, turning years of struggle into a working reality.",-
