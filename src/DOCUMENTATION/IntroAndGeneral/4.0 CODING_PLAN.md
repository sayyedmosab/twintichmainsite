# Intro and General: Coding Plan

## 1.0 Overview

This document outlines a detailed coding plan for the development of the "Intro and General" section of the AI Twin Tech website. The plan is broken down into logical priorities, starting with the foundational elements and moving on to the more complex features, with a focus on actionable tasks for developers.

## 2.0 Development Priorities

### Priority 1: Project Setup and Foundation (Week 1)

*   **Objective:** To set up the project structure and install all necessary dependencies, ensuring a robust development environment.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Initialize a new React project using Vite and TypeScript (`npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts`).
    *   Install and configure Tailwind CSS (`npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`, `npx tailwindcss init -p`).
    *   Install `react-router-dom` for routing (`npm install react-router-dom`).
    *   Set up the basic file structure, including `src/pages`, `src/components`, and `src/context`.
    *   Create the main `App.tsx` and `main.tsx` files with initial boilerplate.

### Priority 2: Basic Layout and Navigation (Week 2)

*   **Objective:** To create the main application layout and implement core navigation components.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Develop the `Header` component (`src/components/Header.tsx`) with the company logo, dynamic logo switching logic, navigation links, and a language switcher.
    *   Develop the `Footer` component (`src/components/Footer.tsx`) with copyright information and a contact link.
    *   Create the main `AppLayout` component (`src/App.tsx`) that includes the `Header` and `Footer` and utilizes `Outlet` for content rendering.
    *   Set up the basic routing in `App.tsx` using `HashRouter` for `HomePage`, `LoginPage`, `RegisterPage`, etc.

### Priority 3: Home Page and Core Content (Week 3)

*   **Objective:** To develop the home page with its engaging visual and narrative features.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Develop the `HomePage` component (`src/pages/HomePage.tsx`).
    *   Integrate the `RubiksIframe` component (`src/components/RubiksIframe.tsx`) to display the Rubik's Cube animation.
    *   Develop the `Hero` and `Frame` components (`src/components/Hero.tsx`, `src/components/Frame.tsx`) for the scrolling narrative sections.
    *   Add the detailed content for the narrative sections within `HomePage.tsx`.

### Priority 4: Robust User Authentication (Week 4)

*   **Objective:** To implement a secure and persistent user authentication system.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Set up the `AuthContext` (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`) to manage user authentication state, including user persistence using `localStorage` and session refreshing logic.
    *   Develop the `LoginPage` (`src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx`) and `RegisterPage` (`src/pages/auth/RegisterPage.tsx`) components with form validation.
    *   Create the backend Express.js API endpoints (`/api/login`, `/api/register`) for user authentication, including password hashing (e.g., bcrypt), JWT generation, and secure session handling.
    *   Connect the frontend authentication components to the backend API, handling successful responses and error states.

### Priority 5: Additional Pages and Content (Week 5)

*   **Objective:** To create the remaining static and informational pages for the "Intro and General" section.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Develop the `JosoorVisionPage` (`src/pages/josoor/JosoorVisionPage.tsx`) for the About section.
    *   Develop the `RoadmapPage` (`src/pages/RoadmapPage.tsx`).
    *   Develop the `ArchitectsForumPage` (`src/pages/ArchitectsForumPage.tsx`).

### Priority 6: Final Touches and Deployment (Week 6)

*   **Objective:** To polish the user interface, ensure cross-browser compatibility, and deploy the application to production.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Perform a final review of the UI and UX, ensuring adherence to the defined Design System.
    *   Conduct cross-browser and cross-device compatibility testing.
    *   Set up the deployment pipelines for the frontend (Vercel) and backend (AWS ECS/Fargate) as per the deployment architecture.
    *   Deploy the application to production, monitoring initial performance and user feedback.
